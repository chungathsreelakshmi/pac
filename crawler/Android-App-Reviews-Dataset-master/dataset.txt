Excellent, I have tried to learn English only by using this dictionary by reading each leaves of it. By now I have used it about 700 hours. I have following suggestions for its developers 1- Divide words to 10 grades. Grade 1 for the most important words to grade 10 for rarely used words (Such as given names or city names. In setting, let users to choose to what level they want to see words as leaves. By this way users can leaf through pages and finally finish all words of dictionary to the level they like. 2- Examples for each words are very excellent and absolutely necessary. These examples should be as simple as possible. Don‚Äôt bring examples from Shakespeare and other advanced books. The aim of this dictionary is to teach English. I couldn‚Äôt use most of your advanced examples by now.*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
Well I don't normally write reviews but this was like too good not to. This is the first time in years they updated their app and the update is just so perfect and helpful. I used to like this dictionary üòåbut now I love itüíï. I'm rating this 5 stars because they deserve it.(Lol... I would rate 10 stars if it were possible. Thanks so much for this update‚úå*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
Hey. I think the previous update made the data processing slow. Once you give search it took like a second before but now it takes upto 4 seconds to process. I've been using it for long so I can differentiate the processing smoothness and speed. Please look into it.*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
I love this app. I only have 1 suggestion. Can you please add a setting qhere thee letters are arranged from a-z. Coz' I'm not really into searching for words. Thats all abd thank you for this wonderful app. I hope my suggestion could be added someday. Tnx :*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
It is amazing. Seriously, all of my search was described well enough. Good relation of words. The only thing that should be tweaked is that we need more details in the context of a word. Overall the content is understandable with a little bit googling. Keep up the hard work dev üíñ*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
Great app. But here is one thing that needs urgent development: when you mark a word, enter into bookmarks to see your marked words, tap onto a marked word to see its meaning, and turn back, you cannot turn back to that specific word on that list -- you go to the beginning of the list of marked words, which is frustrating since you need to scroll down until you find where you left the list when reviewing it. Thanks..*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
I have these offline dictionary apps installed in various languages. The good thing is that they then all become interconnected via the links in entry references. A slight minus point is that entries are sometimes somewhat lacking in information, but this is not the app developer's fault, as they're from a third party, which is Wiktionary. Still very good, so many thanks for making these apps available.*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
I am a bipc student Many words of them are solved by using of this app thank you so much can you give the alphabates order . It can make the original dictionary. not even in searching the people can learn by word after word*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
This is the best dictionary I have ever used. The only unfortunate issue for me is that I had to change my phone from Android to apple and sadly the AppStore doesn't offer this app. So any chance to get this app on AppStore too?? Still waitingüëãüèª*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
After the last update, the app became slow. It takes a good amount of time to search after you press the search button. This app is one of the best you can find out there, so please look into it and try to fix this issue.*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
"Incessantly " check this word pronunciation from Google and Oxford dictionary. I was installed many apps from Google Play Store. especially I was in solid Oxford dictionary which is development by mobi system. In Oxford dictionary, displaying ad and forcing to buy the product. I highly recommend this dictionary based by my experience*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
Please help! This latest update processes searches painfully slower than it was before. Sort the speed issue please. Great job you guys are doing cheers! It's the best dictionary for Android*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
This is literally the best dictionary app. I don't usually write comments but this app is just too damn good. It has got no annoying ads and works offline with no glitch. I wonder how you guys make money without ads :p just go for it.*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
This Livio English dictionary is very great! Only consuming 33MB on phone memory. I only give 4/5 stars coz the pronunciation automated voice is wrong. She pronounces "rendezvous" as "RAN-DIZ-VOS". Hoping the computer voice will be fixed.*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
It's an awesome app, I must say. Provides concise and well defined meanings in no time, it's light and very easy to use. But after the recent update it takes much longer to launch, which is very irritating and is a bad thing as it makes me want to have another app for the purpose. Please fix this ASAP.*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
Please Add features like bookmark revision.... I mean what's the use of bookmark if I can't revise them continuously and I have to go back again and again to bookmarks to revise...... Thank you I hope you guys gonna pay some attention to this........*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
This app is perfect, no bs, it just gives you what you need. I hate the fact that I had to downvote other ratings such as "can you customize this app" or "is there subscription", its a dictionary app ffs, we're here for the contents and its 10/10 good job.*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
Its the best app for those finding it difficult to search word meanings. Its very easy to use and doesn't require any internet connection and it solves your pronunciation problems too. Im satisfied with this app.*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
It is hard to use, the words list is not accessible. Without the words list there will no need for it to be called dictionary. It has good features.*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
This is my favourite dictionary app. I've used it for some time and it's worked fine until recently. For whatever reason, it won't read the words aloud when asked. Anyone else experience this issue?*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
The app was working fine for the past 3 years. I have used it on my other phone too but these days it is crashing continuously. I have thrice installed and uninstalled it but still it fails somedays and works on others.*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
One concern: It has become sliw after last update. I've been waiting since long for next update so that I don't need to give negative comment here. Otherwise, It's amazing for Android devices. Completely Ad free. inflicted form supports. One question- is it available for iOS for iPad? Pl. Solve the sluggishness of app, especially when we select a word in news portal & click share & select Livio Eng dict.*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
I've been using this app for 4yrs. I always avoided to update it, loved the old version. New version is a bit laggy and the UI is nowhere near the old one. I wonder what made you guys change it. I was wonderful. Please there be another update to make the UI as the old one. Please.*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
All things are good in this app but sometimes "text to speech doesn't work " it doesn't read the words aloud . at the same time other apps don't have this problem they read the words loudly . I tried to go in settings and enable text to speech but then also for a while it works and then if I again open the app and click on the speak icon it shows "text to speech failure" then again I do the same thing then after a while again this problem occurs . do this problem have any simple and permanent solution .because I get very bored of this problem .*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
This app is simply awesome, every phone should have this if they are English freak and want to explore more going extra mile as this allows us too bookmark the words u read, learn and listen to .... Awesome*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
The new pronunciations have WAY too many mistakes. My references are "croissant" and "sphenoid" just as of recently. It'd be appreciated if it were looked into. The previous voice program was more correct.*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
App is good, but the problem is, the time it spends before opening the words menu. I think it should be a click and then everything in the menu is shown without waste of time. Also i have text to speech problem.*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
GREAT APP & GREAT WORK & GREAT FEATURES * SPECIALLY OFFLINE FEATURE * INSTANT WORD MEANING IS AVAILABLE * AUDIO EXPLANATION & PRONUNCIATION. 2ND BEST FEATURE THAT IN MEANING IF ANY WORD IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND YOU JUST CLICK THAT WORD & GET ITS MEANING WITHOUT GOING BACK TO THE BEGINING. *****STARS FOR THE DEVELOPERS OF THE APP.*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
While opening the app I have been experiencing issues lately. It takes a long time to open on my Samsung device, which is pretty frustrating.*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
Amazing app. I'm using for last one year. When I downloaded this app that time  have some minor issues. But now no issues in this app. No one app good then this app on this play store.*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
The app has become very slow.! The word processing time is more than 5 seconds.! Before it used to be fast..! Uninstalled for now.! Developer just reply me when you fix this.!*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
By far one of the best dictionary but it could still be better if there were pictures and different accents. Looking forward to the updates. Once I get it, I'll surely rate it 5 stars and suggest this app to all my friends. üòÄ Thanks for creating such a wonderful app*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
The dictionary was excellent before the last update... It became slow after the last update... Now, after typing words into the dictionary, it takes time for their meanings to come up...*--^--*Books &amp; Reference

I have been using it for quite a long time and have still found no parallel dictionary like this.It meets all my needs which is supposed by a sublime dic like this.*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
Excellent. It also provides idioms that other (online dictionaries don't. If anything, I must say that, when looking up very unusual words (especially adverbs it's always safer to check them also on another reliable dictionary, for at times this one lists terms that are not considered as proper terms by other dictionaries but merely as 'once-created, once-used' colloquialisms.*--^--*Books &amp; Reference
I have been using this for couple of years. recently I am facing with text-speech failure. Updating or reinstalling the app did not help.*--^--*Books &amp; Reference

I didn't like the rocket ships shooting the synonyms and numbers. It moved way too fast, and I sometimes had to tap the word several times to make it shoot. I tried adjusting the speed setting to slow but it didn't seem to slow it down at all. I just purchased this for my 6 year old grandaughter but I think this part of the game will be too frustrating for her. It would be better if the words or numbers didn't move at all so the child has time to read the answers and think about it!  Other than the two games with the rocketship, the rest of the app is great.*--^--*Educational
My boyfriend's daughter loves these games. My only wish is as a parent he or I could set the difficulty level for the games instead of leaving it up to her. We've unlocked her grade and the next grade. I wish I could make the first one tougher since we're near the end of the year. Also the games don't seem to explain how to play them sometimes or explain correct answers so it threw off her score the first times she played. She keeps struggling on place values but the game doesn't ever explain what they are and this is ahead of her grade so she hasn't covered it in class.*--^--*Educational
Great but the time games froze always..locked up the tablet. My daughter loves the app....but*--^--*Educational

Galaxy Note 8, unfortunately nearly none of the function were working. Crashing, freezing, weird distortions in graphics. Could not get a single accurate target with my finger. The screen was going around in a loop. Could not get back to auto mode. Could not zoom on anything I wanted. I'm pretty disappointed, because the images look OK.*--^--*Education
This app is the best at what it does, I love it. If you get it, get the full version. Just do it. Go for it. It's worth it.*--^--*Education
The app is good, but i don't see satellites at all and navigation is a bit awkward. When you zoom in on a specific far away star, it shakes a lot, no stabilization on zoom. But I've no idea yet how to turn on satellites, even though the setting is on*--^--*Education
This is a decent app. But the orbit lines don't appear. And it's inaccurate. At this time, the map shows Venus directly below the moon. And I'm looking up at the night sky... and Venus is to the LEFT of the moon.*--^--*Education
This App is really fascinating and utterly beautiful...! There's one very minor bug, though. The App always opens with "atmosphere" showing, even when it's turned off is settings. Apart from that, brilliant!*--^--*Education
Puts unwanted alerts in the notification bar and plays an alert sound, and the notification settings don't provide a visible way to disable this. This is extremely bad practice IMO, so 1 star until this feature is removed.*--^--*Education
I don't usually leave reviews but this AR planetarium is so gorgeous and simple to use I feel like supporting it with heartfull 5* :*--^--*Education

What has happened to star chart, I'm not one to update apps often but a recent soft bricking of my phone has downloaded what I can only describe as a terrible progress in a once amazing app.  Why have you done this, is there any way I can access an older version, I'm seriously dissatisfied with the new version.  The old version was far superior, This new version is terrible, I would never have paid for this originally..*--^--*Education
Okay*--^--*Education

Use the free version until all the issues are fixed. The notification settings don't work, the whole app is built sideways (phone thinks it's landscape when the app is portrait, the search function doesn't seem to work reliably*--^--*Education
I've used this app for over a year now and it's great. The big visual update that just happen looks nice, but now the "Time Shift" option is no longer in the upper right corner.*--^--*Education
Very detailed. The sky view is fun to use. The UI could use some work. Still a cool app to have handy though.*--^--*Education
Used to be great. However after not using it for awhile I come back to find it's been completely broken and is unusable on both my Samsung S4 phone and brand new Galaxy Tab A tablet. On both It takes much longer to load than it used to, just to get to an unresponsive and almost pitch black main menu.*--^--*Education
Cannot navigate on my Motorola Droid smart phone. Cannot see controls. No way to search for anything. I wanted to see the Chinese space station path, but could not figure it out. Music not good if outside. How do you turn this feature off. Very frustrating to use.*--^--*Education
The app is completely unusable after the new update. The frames exceeds the display on Moto G5S Plus, no options or menu is found and the AR mode is completely missing. Unacceptable for an app priced at this cost. Liked the old version a lot. Hope the developers look into the problems. Would give the old version 5 stars.*--^--*Education
Like other recent reviewers are asking : What happened? It used to be outstanding, now the updated version is absolutely horrible. The fact that there is no way to turn the grating sound effect off seems to bespeak supreme force-my-creepy-tastes-down-your-throat arrogance. Bought this months ago when it was good. Oh well. Off you go, never to return.*--^--*Education
This update makes me want a refund. Its not even like the pic anymore.My Moto has it all complicated. I don't want to use it anymore. Go back to the old format this one was never a good idea. Fire the team that thought it was.*--^--*Education
I really like this app and have been using it for some time. Very accurate and easy to use... However, recent updates have introduced some "useless" additions which are really annoying... The accompanying sound for example, serves no purpose and is highly irritating but you can't turn it off. I'm sure it will be resolved soon but until then I'll use another sky chart.*--^--*Education
Need a very fast phone to run latest version. Almost useless on my LG G3. Disappointed.*--^--*Education
Right... so NOW the app takes an age to load, has silly 'cricket' and offputting 'moody spacey' sound fx in the menu and Sky View modes etc [that, irritatingly, cannot be disabled - why, I don't know] and for some reason, it won't zoom in and out on Sky View and those sort of finger movements lead it to revert back to the menu system. Oh and your new [again, for whatever reason] 'undisabable' notifications are just making me wanna uninstall the app. Used to be great. Come on guys, prime example of the old saying 'if it ain't broken, don't fix it'. Don't spoil it, boys.*--^--*Education
Didn't think I'd be editing my review so quickly, but the new update does indeed enable the app to run smoothly on both my Note8 & S9+ in AR mode.*--^--*Education
Okay , what to say about the update:  Pros:  - the new "moments in time" section is pretty nice.  Cons: - visually speaking I preferred the way the app was before, both menu and sky graphics look less beautiful in my opinion.*--^--*Education
The older version had a window with useful info as seen in the screenshots above, but the current version is almost impossible to use and close in on the info of the star. You have to wait patiently for them to be displayed.*--^--*Education
My wife and I are new to astronomy and have developed a love and fascination with the night sky. Star chart has enriched our experience and helps us locate and identify objects so easily. Fantastic app five stars!*--^--*Education
Updated review/ From 1 star to 5 stars. The new update is awesome, AR mode is smooth , the 3 modes on the menu are perfect and whom ever did the click sounds is a genius. I rarely write reviews but for such work I say well doneüëçüèº*--^--*Education
Okay. Okay. Okay. Let me get this straight. Last week, I would have a given a five star review on your app. I apologize I haven't wrote one until now, it's seems the human way to complain because it's easier, than to give genuine praise. I'm very sorry, I will work on it.  But I must say something.  The latest update - "make over" - of Star Chart sucks. The "main menu" has really tacky graphics - c'mon, this ain't the Oregon Trail -the new "moments in time" feature is kinda cool, but it's totally pointless and just takes up too much space to bother including it. The main problem I have though, besides the looooaaaddddiiinnngggg and the tacky graphics, is the fact that it isn't even educational. There was sooooo much information before, you could see what the sky looked like tonight, yesterday, and twenty years in the future. Every star, messier, comet had a name and some cool info about. Simply amazing! Those were the days. This new update spoils all that. It feels like a cheap simulator from 2002. I am uninstalling this app. Six dollars down the drain. This app is not what I paid for. Still,  I used to really love this app. So in conclusion I want to say thank you to the developers, it was a great idea. So have a good one :*--^--*Education
Great update! Love the explore mode! If you could update the satellite positions, I would give it 5 üåü*--^--*Education
"Choose from 7 different locations"... as long as you pay ¬£2 for each of them even after paying for the game. Complete scam, do not buy.*--^--*Education
Should have read the reviews first but I assumed since I was paying for the app I would have access to ALL of the content, but no. On top of the $3.99 I paid to just download the app, I am also supposed to pay $1.99 for every section my son wants to play? Yeah... no. If I could get a refund, I would, but since I can't, $3.99 is all you will be getting from me. What a scam.*--^--*Education
Says no no no no no to this game because you buy it and then you have to spend more and more and more money no no no and he's four*--^--*Education
New Blaze And The Monster Machines WeekDays At 10:30\9:30C And 11:00/10:00C On Nickelodeon and every night on nick jr*--^--*Education
This game is very American super the Blaze very super truck*--^--*Education
How much is the game*--^--*Education
I love Blaze and the monster machines*--^--*Education
This game is cool*--^--*Education
My son loves the game, but paying $2 each to unlock the 4 additional levels, on top of the $4 the game cost is ridiculous.  There should be a way to unlock levels by game play.  My son is very disappointed that he can't race on more than the 3 levels that come with the game.  I would expect more from Nickelodeon.*--^--*Education
I bought this App just like I do for other providers cartoon network PBS KIDS and many more... make videos from the gaming and upload on my daughter's YouTube channel... but wow B.Viacom how low are are willing to go blocking them. And cockfighting them. I have a following on social media aghast I direct here to buy the apps but even then WOW thank God I got accepted in art school I am gonna learn to make my own animations and videos Bye.*--^--*Education
Why make us pay for the app if we have to buy all of the levels? READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU BUY IT. This is a total rip off. You have to purchase all additional levels. It's disgusting these people would scams you out of money like this. DO NOT BUY.*--^--*Education
I don't like it it is so hard to turn I would just stop selling it PS it is due*--^--*Education
I hate it because it is so hard to stear*--^--*Education
This game is freee i can play some levels without paying!! Even if i need to pay, the levels are only 2.00!*--^--*Education
The information is prohibited intended only solely to those that of cours Hooda Math on OK*--^--*Education

Everything cost*--^--*Education
My 3yr old loves it*--^--*Education
I purchased all the extra levels it says that I have already purchased them but they are still locked. I'm extremely frustrated I've spent a lot of money for this to not work.*--^--*Education
Kids like the game well enough, but it was clearly made to sell the DLC. Only one level set is open from the base purchase, and the rest need to be paid for separately, at a total cost higher than the initial purchase price (though I got it on sale.*--^--*Education
Was unsure of trying this game after reading the reviews, but I risked it and Im glad I did. It downloaded straight away and plays perfectly. I havnt yet experienced any issues. My 3 year old loves it.*--^--*Education
I like it b/c my 5yr old son likes it... DON'T LIKE that he is asking me to buy more in it...only 1 track...come on. ..little sad...but again...kid is happy so that's what matters to me.*--^--*Education
Paid to download, now required to pay more for more than one level*--^--*Education
After paying for this for my five year old grandson, which he love Blaze but now I have to pay  for extra track for him to enjoy.*--^--*Education
Really? Big name company and app developer and the app won't even install? It's not just me but others have the same problem. To make matters worse, refund option is not available. GOOGLE or NICKELODEON, please read anyone's comments read and either fix or pull this app.*--^--*Education
$7 for an app that won't open. Don't waste your money. I reinstalled twice and purchased twice (my son is obsessed and nothing.*--^--*Education
The game itself isn't bad but its pretty horrible you pay 6.99 for the app and then they want you to pay more for more tracks!!  I honestly don't know how some people sleep at night....GREEDY GREEDY GREEDY!!!!*--^--*Education
My brother wanted this for years I said I didn't have enough now he's playing it and its a fully functional game these kind of games can take even almost a year, jeez be thankfull. God!. People waste thousands of dollars to even build games for YOUR entertainment they don't HAVE to be made good job Nickelodeon thanks for spending all that time to make this game you never needed to but did. AND the price is high because they waste months building games like these Jeez people learn to be thankfull some have*--^--*Education
I love the game and the robots and letters and numbers!*--^--*Educational
My son loves this game. Wish there was a bit more variety but both my boys enjoy it.*--^--*Educational
My 3 yr old was bored with this is within 15 min.  Only 4 games that are repeated over and over which are too simple for a 3 yr old.  Very little to to nothing with animation, voice is irritating.  If this had been a free download it would still  be uninstalled.  Big waste of money.*--^--*Educational
Was actually bought this to be installed on my galaxy tab 4.7 but it can not be installed on the tab, so i ended up installing it at my lg g3, and it works fine. My son loves the game.*--^--*Educational
I love the monkey series and own most of the apps. However, this one is buggy and full of graphical glitches. I tried it on multiple devices and had the same issues*--^--*Educational
No Family Library support for older purchases before July 2016 - so no loyalty for older customers. Deducted stars as a result. Shame.*--^--*Educational
It's on my phone. Wont even work. My kids are bored with it. Work on my galaxy tab*--^--*Educational
My son loves this game but it crashes  after one round every time. Dissapointed because I paid for a game he can't use. I've sent reports but it still crashes.*--^--*Educational
This whole collection rocks! If you have a child who's outgrown Monkey Preschool Lunchbox, this is a little more advanced.*--^--*Educational
Just the same thing over and over. Too over stimulating.  Would not consider this an educational game at all. Toca boca has much better learning games*--^--*Educational
Only 3 or 4 games repeated over and over, and don't get any more difficult. Should be free.*--^--*Educational
Works great on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, DOESN'T work on the Galaxy S3. Luckily my daughter uses the Tab. She's 2 and needs help but she LOVES all the Thup monkey games.*--^--*Educational
The monkey preschool apps are great and my 2 year old loves them!*--^--*Educational
Can not install on Galaxy  Tab 4. Looked for the APK trying to fix it but can't  find one.*--^--*Educational
Sound but no picture, realised too late for a refund*--^--*Educational
My 3 yr old has been playing these games for more than a year. Its a good learning game and she just looves that monkey. Highly recommended.*--^--*Educational

My toddler loves it. Fast placed to keep thier attention but each games has a learning aspect.*--^--*Educational
First time I tried it out, because I try all games before my four year old, it shut off in the middle of game. I didn't even play for two minutes.*--^--*Educational
my 3 yr old thinks this game is best. The simplicity and fast action keep her interested. Good game for hand eye coordination.*--^--*Educational
My 1 year old (almost 2 loves this! He learned some letter & colors from this app.*--^--*Educational
Good she likes this app... It keeps her busy when I'm in a waiting room.*--^--*Educational
My almost three year old is playing like a champ. Only downside is she asks for monkey everywhere!*--^--*Educational
Great! Great! Great! I purchased all of THUP games... something about that monkey, my  2 year old loves!*--^--*Educational
At just 18 mo daughter was playing this app appropriately and she is almost 3 and still loves it!!!*--^--*Educational
